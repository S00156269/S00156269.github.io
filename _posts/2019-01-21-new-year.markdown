A belated but happy New Year! As the interim presentation approaches, I thought it'd be good to check in. Progress on the project is going smoothly, and I should have everything done in time for the presentation.

Unfortunately I was ill this Christmas and I had to defer my exams in order to take some time off, which has put me back a bit. Nevertheless, I'm sure that I'll be able to show off the key features of my project.

I'm excited to start my new modules this semester, especially User Experience and Machine Learning. I'm also looking forward to honing my C# skills in Advanced Programming. Here's to a productive year!
