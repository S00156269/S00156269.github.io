Things are ticking along pretty nicely. Had my first meeting with my supervisor about my 4th year project. Was very productive and enlightening! I'm going to focus on what sets Auteur apart from other movie review apps.


Auteur will be a place to review films and discuss them with your friends. I'm going to focus on three key features which I believe are important:
1. A recommendation system, utilising machine learning to give the user intelligent film recommendations.
2. An auto-moderation system, which will help moderators keep the community welcoming by notifying them of toxic comments. I hope to achieve this using a Natural Language API, like Google's Cloud Natural Language offering.
3. Integration with Discord, using a small API and a bot which will allow users to request stuff to appear in the server, such as a film, a specific review etc.

Those features, along with some non-functional requirements like high availabilty, good UX and performance, should hopefully encourage people to use my app. I'm involved in a few film communities, so hopefully I can incorporate their feedback into the working process.

My aim is to get the basic features done by January, then I can really focus on the key features. Fingers crossed!
