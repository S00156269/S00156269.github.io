4 weeks into our college year already! I'm glad to be back. 
Plenty of new stuff to get to grips with, including new languages like Prolog and Python.
And of course, our 4th year project!

I've decided to create a movie review site called Auteur. It will allow users to create reviews, add friends, get intelligent recommendations, and more! I'm quite excited about it.
It'll be built with the latest version of Angular, and styled with Angular Material using HammerJS for animations.
This blog, which you're on right now, is powered by Github Pages and Jekyll.
I'm currently at the initial stages of the project, gathering user stories and sussing out the component tree.
